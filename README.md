# AppledGold
Download the Minecraft 1.13.2 Forge and 1.16.5 Fabric Versions of the mod here.

# Instructions for the 1.16.5 Fabric Mod (for windows OS)
Download the Fabric Appled Gold jar file from this repo.

Download the Fabric API (this is another mod that you need) from curseforge here (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files). Make sure you get the 1.16.5 version

Download the Fabric Minecraft Launcher for 1.16.5 (this is different than the Forge one) here (https://fabricmc.net/use/)

Once you've downloaded all three things, the two mods and the launcher are on your computer, double click the launcher and click Install.

Now navigate to your %appdata% and .minecraft folder and copy both the appled gold and fabric API mods into the mods folder

Last step is to launch minecraft and make sure that the version you are playing in is Fabric 1.16.5 otherwise the mods wont load.

Now you can play singleplayer or on a multiplayer server that has this mod!!
